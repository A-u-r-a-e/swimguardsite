                <div class="story-content">
                    <p class="lead">
                        SwimGuard was founded by two high school students at
                        Shanghai American School with a simple but powerful
                        belief: every pool should have access to life-saving
                        technology, regardless of budget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've seen the unspoken dangers of indoors pools
                        ourselves, with in-pool drowning causing 300,000 deaths
                        annually and 30 people every hour worldwide. We saw
                        Shanghai's 1,094 licensed pools serving 7 million summer
                        visitors, yet struggling with impractical detection
                        systems so expensive that most facilities wouldn't
                        bother to even consider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Combining our expertise in artificial intelligence,
                        computer vision, and business strategy, we set out to
                        create a drowning detection solution that breaks down
                        the barriers of cost and complexity. SwimGuardian is the
                        result of countless hours of research, development, and
                        a deep commitment to making pool safety accessible to
                        everyone. We achieved 91% detection accuracy with 100%
                        true positive rate while keeping internal hardware
                        expenses to just RMB 230 per unit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission goes beyond building a product – we're
                        building a movement to prevent drowning deaths through
                        innovation, affordability, and accessibility.
